### Summary

This is an example usage of Cypress (<https://www.cypress.io/>) against the-internet sandbox (<https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/>).

Note: Develop on/for Mac.  It _should_ work on other platforms, but caveat emptor.

### Requirements
- NodeJS 6+

### Getting started
- From the project root, run `npm install`

### Execution
- To open the desktop app, from the project root, run `$(npm bin)/cypress open`
- Click an individual test, or 'Run All Tests'

## CLI options

### Troubleshooting
> Cypress install halts shortly before completion
This is normally caused by using a Node version <6.  Update and the install should work fine.
